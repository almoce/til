# about nft, simple way explain

### how nft works
> NFT - non fugible token  

- ower create a media, then bind to a token. recently most project is about upload the media art to the IPFS, which will generate a unique id   
- then create a token with smart contract in the blockchain, which will bind with the media metadata. so this token will relate with this unique id = nft  
- what make this token special is about the creator and the media, on the blockchain, even if this token is made with transactions, we can still trace back to the origin of the chain to identify the creator or the original owner

# about nft & ipfs, simple way explain

### NFT
> NFT - non fugible token  

- ower create a media, then bind to a token. recently most project is about upload the media art to the IPFS, which will generate a unique id   
- then create a token with smart contract in the blockchain, which will bind with the media metadata. so this token will relate with this unique id = nft  
- what make this token special is about the creator and the media, on the blockchain, even if this token is made with transactions, we can still trace back to the origin of the chain to identify the creator or the original owner

### IPFS
ipfs as decentralized file system, make eveyone as a host, who reqeust download the file would make the one be come a host. which will result who create the content will be distributed to in all the network for who had download it and become the host, so that you can not remove the file form it, it will permenace on the network.   
but there will be case like you upload the file, and no one request it befor you shotdown your own server, or everyone who requested the fill have shotdown the own server, which will result the file become inaccessible from the network.

# Extensions

## Autolink extension

If the `autolink` extension is enabled the URL https://www.github.com is displayed as a link.

## Emoji extension

Using the `emoji` extension you can replace the `:smile:` with :smile:. 

You can choose to use the standard emoji font or the GitHub images.
Multibyte emoji are also supported, so `:it:` equivalent to the code `\u1f1ee\u1f1f9` must be rendered as the Italian flag :it:.

## GitHub mentions extension

With the `mentions` extension @sbarex is rendered as a link to the GitHub account.

## Heads extension

With the `heads` extension for each heads is created an anchor named with the title, lowercased, and space replaced with a hypen sign.
The anchors can be used for cross links. 

If enabled the links inside the [TOC](#toc) section works. 

## Inline images extension

The `inline image` extension embed the local image inside the HTML output. **Is required for view local images in the Quick Look preview.**
